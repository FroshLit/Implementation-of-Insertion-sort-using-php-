# Implementation-of-Insertion-sort-using-php-

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

Algorithm:
// Sort an arr[] of size n
insertionSort(arr, n)
Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
	Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0â€¦i-1]

Time Complexity: O(n*2)
Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. And it takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Algorithmic Paradigm: Incremental Approach

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes
